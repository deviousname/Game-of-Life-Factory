## Overview

This game is a dynamic cellular automaton simulation where players build, simulate, and manipulate grids of cells governed by various rulesets. It allows the player to create, simulate, and visualize how different rules influence the behavior of cells. The player can switch between **building** and **simulation** modes, modify rulesets, manage an inventory of logic blocks, and generate energy through the simulation.

## Controls

### General Controls
- **`TAB`**: Toggle between building and simulation modes.
- **`ESC`**: Open/close the game menu or return to building mode from a submenu.
- **`A`/`D`**: Cycle through available rulesets (building mode) or colors (simulation mode).
- **`R`**: Reset the game grid.
- **`F`**: Use the flood-fill tool to fill cells based on the current ruleset (building mode) or color (simulation mode).
- **`SPACE`**: Pause or unpause the simulation.
- **`B`**: Open the buy menu to purchase logic blocks for different rulesets using energy.
- **`N`**: Toggle between scientific and standard number notation.

### Mouse Controls
- **Left-click (building mode)**: Place the selected ruleset block in the grid.
- **Right-click (building mode)**: Erase a block by setting it to "Void".
- **Left-click (simulation mode)**: Paint living cells with the selected color.
- **Right-click (simulation mode)**: Erase cells (set them to dead state).

## Game Modes

### Building Mode
- In building mode, you can place logic blocks from different rulesets on the grid.
- **Rulesets** define how cells behave, whether they live, die, or are born.
- Logic blocks are drawn from your inventory. Some blocks (like **Conway** and **Void**) are infinite, but others need to be bought using energy.

### Simulation Mode
- In this mode, cells interact according to the rulesets applied to them. Cells can live, die, or reproduce based on their neighboring cells.
- You can paint cells with different colors to visualize the patterns that emerge in the simulation.
- The simulation can be paused and resumed.

### Menu Mode
- Press `ESC` to access the game menu where you can copy the current game state to the clipboard or load a game state from the clipboard.

### Buy Menu
- Press `B` to open the buy menu, where you can spend energy to purchase additional logic blocks.
- Energy is generated by living cells during the simulation. The more cells, the more energy you earn.

### Shop/Upgrade System
- In addition to purchasing blocks, each logic block has a **tier** that can be upgraded, enhancing its effect in the simulation.

## Logic Block Inventory
- Each logic block corresponds to a different ruleset, dictating how cells behave in the simulation.
- **Void** blocks clear a space, while other blocks define how cells grow or die.
- You start with an unlimited number of **Conway** and **Void** blocks, but other rulesets must be purchased with energy. Tiers can be upgraded to improve block performance.

## Rulesets

The game includes several different rulesets, each with its own birth (`B`) and survival (`S`) conditions:
- **Void**: All cells die in this space.
- **Conway**: Standard Game of Life rules where cells survive with 2-3 neighbors and are born with exactly 3.
- **HighLife**: Similar to Conway but cells are also born with 6 neighbors.
- **Day & Night**: Allows cells to both survive and be born under a variety of neighbor configurations.
- **Seeds**, **Life Without Death**, **Maze**, **Gnarl**, and **Replicator**: Each has unique behavior patterns for survival and birth.

## Clipboard Functionality

You can copy the game state to the clipboard or load a saved state:
- **Copy**: Copies the current grid, inventory, and energy state to the clipboard as a seed string.
- **Paste**: Loads a saved state from the clipboard if a valid seed string is present.

## Energy System

- As cells grow and reproduce in simulation mode, they generate **energy** for the player.
- Energy can be spent in the **Buy Menu** to purchase additional blocks of logic or upgrade their tiers for stronger effects.

## Tallying System & Bonuses

- The game tracks and tallies cells based on color diversity and activity, granting **bonuses** for diverse or stable cell arrangements.
- **Offense** is tracked by the number of new active cells, while **Defense** is tracked by static living cells.

## Notes

- Press `ESC` to open the game menu, where you can copy or paste game states.
- The game runs continuously, updating the simulation and rendering in real-time. You can pause and unpause the simulation with the `SPACE` key.
