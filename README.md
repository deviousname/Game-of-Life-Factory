## Overview

**Game of Life Factory** is an interactive game that combines the classic **Conway's Game of Life** with resource management and strategy elements. Players can place cells on a grid, assign different logic rulesets to each cell, and observe the dynamic behavior as the simulation runs. The game offers multiple rulesets like **Conway's Life**, **HighLife**, **Maze**, and others, which provide different patterns of cell birth and survival. You can switch between **Build Mode** (where you configure and place cells) and **Simulation Mode** (where cells evolve based on the selected rules).

The core challenge lies in balancing your resources (energy) and strategically placing logic blocks to create sustainable and interesting patterns. As cells survive and reproduce, they generate energy that can be used to buy more logic blocks or upgrade existing ones. Players can pause the game, paint live cells, and explore various strategies for creating self-sustaining cell structures.

### Features:
- **Multiple Rulesets:** Choose from various rulesets such as **Conway**, **HighLife**, **Day & Night**, and more.
- **Resource Management:** Accumulate energy from cell growth and spend it to buy or upgrade logic blocks.
- **Interactive Grid:** Switch between building and simulating cell patterns, and visually see the impact of your setup.
- **Customizable Setup:** Use different colors and patterns to create unique visual and strategic experiences.
- **Clipboard Integration:** Save and load game states using generated seeds.
